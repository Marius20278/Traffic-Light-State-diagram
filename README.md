# Gishushu Traffic Lights State Machine
# Overview

This project models the behavior of a traffic light system as a state machine. It uses Drawio to create a visual state diagram that simulates the different states
of a traffic light, including normal operation, pedestrian signals, emergency flashing mode, and maintenance mode.

# Features
1. Basic Traffic Light Operation: Cycles through red, green, and yellow states based on timers.
2. Pedestrian Crossing: Manages pedestrian requests with Walk, Flashing Don't Walk, and Don't Walk states.
3. Emergency Mode: Activates a flashing yellow light in emergencies.
4. Maintenance Mode: Allows manual override to switch off all lights for maintenance.

 # Prerequisites
To view or modify this state diagram, you will need:

1. Draw.io (diagrams.net): A free online diagramming tool that allows you to create, view, and edit state diagrams.
2. Browser: Since Draw.io is web-based, you can access it on any modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
